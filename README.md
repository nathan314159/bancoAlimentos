📌 Banco de Alimentos de Imbabura – Socioeconomic Data Management System

1️⃣ What is the purpose of this project?

This project is a socioeconomic data collection and management system developed for the Banco de Alimentos de Imbabura (B.A.D.I.), a government-supported organization that assists low-income families.
The purpose of the system is to:

Digitize the household survey process conducted by field employees

Standardize data collection across provinces and cantons

Structure beneficiary information in a relational database

Support decision-making based on accurate and organized data

Prepare validated data for future deployment and production use

It replaces manual or paper-based surveys with a structured digital workflow.

2️⃣ What problem does it solve?

Before this system, the data collection process faced several challenges:

Manual and inconsistent data collection

Human error

Incomplete forms

Inconsistent formats

Difficulty validating information

No centralized database

No real-time validation

Difficulty generating reports

Lack of data traceability

Limited scalability

3️⃣ Tech Stack

Backend: PHP (CodeIgniter)

Frontend: JavaScript

Database: MySQL

Mobile: Python (Flet)

Version Control: Git & GitHub

4️⃣ Key Features

Dynamic household member registration (supports unlimited members)

Hierarchical geographic selection (Province → Canton → Parish)
